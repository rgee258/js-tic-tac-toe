# JS Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains a two player game of Tic Tac Toe. Simply add your names to the game, press the new game button, and click away to play.

This app was created for the purpose of practicing the usage of factory functions and modules in JS. All of the functions used in this script are contained in either a factory function or module without any variables or functions in the global scope.
